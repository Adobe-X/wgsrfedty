Adobe Audition is a professional solution for recording, editing, and mastering audio material. The editor processes all important formats from MP3 through AAC to AIFF and imports audio tracks from CDs.

The multitrack editor lets you mix your music, voice, and sound clips on any number of tracks, using a wealth of studio and dynamic effects such as reverb and echo, compressors, limiters, and equalizers. With "Audition," you also edit and synchronize audio tracks of SD and HD videos.

The internal sound card or audio interfaces, such as the Pro Tools Mbox, record external sound signals.
